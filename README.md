# RFSoC-3D-print-box
A parameterised box for the RFSoC 4x2, made with Autodesk Fusion.
Has M3 heatset inserts for board mounting, and lid fastening.

We print our boxes with PETG-CF on a Bambu Lab H2S.

7 (board) + 4 (lid) + 6 (optional box mount) = 17 heat set M3 inserts per box.
Lid needs M3 countersunk screws.
We use M3 socket cap screws for the board.
